Description: Functions are provided to calculate the 'ALINE' Distance between words as per 
    (Kondrak 2000) and (Downey, Hallmark, Cox, Norquest, & Lansing, 2008, 
    <doi:10.1080/09296170802326681>). The score is based on phonetic features represented 
    using the Unicode-compliant International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). Parameterized 
    features weights are used to determine the optimal alignment and functions are
    provided to estimate optimum values using a genetic algorithm and supervised 
    learning. See (Downey, Sun, and Norquest 2017, 
    <https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2017/RJ-2017-005/index.html>.
